# Theorem

Learning FP Scala one TypeClass at a time...

## Structure

- `demo` - contains examples
- `laws` - contains laws for `Type Classes`
- `std` - standard library of `Type Class` instances
- `syntax` - implicits for nicer syntax


## Tests

Currently tests contain checks for some `Type Class` instances.
